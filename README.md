Reflections on encapsulation and generalization:

Encapsulation allows one to organize the code/drawings into smaller self-contained functions
which makes the code easier to read, maintain, and reuse. Further, encapsulating the code into functions
made the code modular. This made it so one could add more mouths to the pumpkins, a second body, or however many eyes 
they wanted.


Generalization allows the functions to be adaptable to different inputs. I Would not have been able
to fix the pumpkin drawings easily if it weren't for the generalization of the code. I could change values such as size
and radius easily instead of dealing with functions with hardcoded values. This also made it simple to reuse code and 
make new pumpkins by just changing the input parameters.
